# Game of Life

Conway's Game of Life (see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) to learn more) with different speeds, and some preset patterns to watch (and get inspired to create some more!)

Important note: this game of life is on a finite grid, not the classic infinite grid. In particular, the top and the bottom of the grid are connected as well as the left and the right sides, which changes the existential conditions for tiles along the edges.
